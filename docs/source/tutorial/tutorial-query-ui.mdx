title: Query-powered UI
---

import DetailUISetupPanel from "./components/detail_ui_setup_panel.mdx"

Now that your app can execute queries against a GraphQL server, you can reflect the results of those queries in your UI.

## Remove boilerplate code

In `MasterViewController.swift`, delete the following pieces of boilerplate code that the app doesn't need: 

- The `objects` property
- Everything in `viewDidLoad` except the `super.viewDidLoad()` call
- The entire `insertNewObject()` method
- The contents of `prepareForSegue()` (but not the method itself)
- The entire `tableView(_, canEditRowAt:)` method
- The entire `tableView(_, commit:, forRowAt:)` method

## Add query fields

Now let's add properties to display the results of the `LaunchListQuery` you built in the previous tutorial step. 

At the top of `MasterViewController.swift`, add a new property to store the launches that the query returns: 

```swift
var launches = [LaunchListQuery.Data.Launch.Launch]()
```

Why the long name? Each query returns its own nested object structure to ensure that when you use the result of a particular query, you can't ask for a property that isn't present. Because this screen will be populated by the results of the `LaunchListQuery`, you need to display subtypes of that particular query.

Next, add an enum that helps handle dealing with sections (we'll add additional items to the enum later): 

```swift
enum ListSection: Int, CaseIterable {
  case launches
}
```

## Fill in required methods

Now we can update the various `UITableViewDataSource` methods to use the result of our query.

For `numberOfSections(in:)`, you can use the `allCases` property from `CaseIterable` to provide the appropriate number of sections:

```swift
override func numberOfSections(in tableView: UITableView) -> Int {
  return ListSection.allCases.count
}
```

For `tableView(_:numberOfRowsInSection:)`, you can try instantiating a `ListSection` enum object. If it doesn't work, that's an invalid section, and if it does, you can `switch` directly on the result. In this case, you'll want to return the count of launches:

```swift
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
  guard let listSection = ListSection(rawValue: section) else {
    assertionFailure("Invalid section")
    return 0
  }
        
  switch listSection {
  case .launches:
    return self.launches.count
  }
}
```

For `tableView(_:cellForRowAt:)`, you can use the existing cell dequeueing mechansim, the same section check as in `tableView(_:numberOfRowsInSection)`, and then configure the cell based on what section it's in.

For this initial section, grab a launch out of the `launches` array at the index of `indexPath.row`, and update the `textLabel` to display the launch site:

```swift
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
  let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "Cell", for: indexPath)

  guard let listSection = ListSection(rawValue: indexPath.section) else {
    assertionFailure("Invalid section")
    return cell
  }
    
  switch listSection {
  case .launches:
    let launch = self.launches[indexPath.row]
    cell.textLabel?.text = launch.site
  }
    
  return cell
}
```

Your table view has all the information it needs to populate itself when the `launches` array has contents. Now it's time to actually get those contents from the server. 

First, add a method for showing errors at the end of your file: 

```swift
private func showErrorAlert(title: String, message: String) {
  let alert = UIAlertController(title: title,
                                message: message,
                                preferredStyle: .alert) 
  alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "OK", style: .default))
  self.present(alert, animated: true)
}
```

Next, add a method to load the launches. You'll use a setup similar to the one you used to set this up in the `AppDelegate` earlier. 

However, you need to make sure that a call doesn't try to call back and use elements that are no longer there, so you'll check to make sure that the `MasterViewController` hasn't been deallocated out from under you by passing in `[weak self]` and unwrapping `self` before proceeding with updating the UI:

```swift
private func loadLaunches() {
  Network.shared.apollo
    .fetch(query: LaunchListQuery()) { [weak self] result in
    
      guard let self = self else {
        return
      }

      defer {
        self.tableView.reloadData()
      }
            
      switch result {
      case .success(let graphQLResult):
        // TODO
      case .failure(let error):
        self.showErrorAlert(title: "Network Error",
                            message: error.localizedDescription)
      }
  }
}
```


`GraphQLResult` has both a `data` property and an `errors` property. This is because GraphQL allows partial data to be returned if it's non-null. 

In the example we're working with now, we could theoretically obtain a list of launches, and then an error stating that a launch with a particular ID could not be constructed. 

This is why when you get a `GraphQLResult`, you generally want to check both the `data` property (to display any results you got from the server) _and_ the `errors` property (to try to handle any errors you received from the server). 

Replace the `// TODO` in the code above with the following code to handle both data and errors:

```swift
if let launchConnection = graphQLResult.data?.launches {
  self.launches.append(contentsOf: launchConnection.launches.compactMap { $0 })
}
        
if let errors = graphQLResult.errors {
  let message = errors
        .map { $0.localizedDescription }
        .joined(separator: "\n")
  self.showErrorAlert(title: "GraphQL Error(s)",
                      message: message)    
}
```

Finally, you need to actually call the method you just added to kick off the call to the network when the view is first loaded. Update your `viewDidLoad` to also call `loadLaunches`: 

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  self.loadLaunches()
}
```

Build and run the application. After the query completes, a list of launch sites appears: 


<img src="images/list_sites_success.png" alt="List of launch sites" width="300">
</img>


However, if you attempt to tap one of the rows, the app displays the detail with the the placeholder text you can see in the storyboard rather than any actual information about the launch:


<img src="images/stock_detail_view.png" alt="Placeholder detail content" width="300">
</img>


To send that information through, you need to build out the `MasterViewController`'s `prepareForSegue` method, and have a way for that method to pass the `DetailViewController` information about the launch.

## Pass information to the detail view

Let's update the `DetailViewController` to be able to handle information about a launch. 

Open `DetailViewController.swift` and delete the `detailItem` property at the bottom of the class (you won't need it).

Next, because you're going to add a property that uses a type defined in the Apollo SDK, you need to add an `import` statement to the top of the file:

```swift
import Apollo
```

Next, add a new property at the top of the class:  

```swift
var launchID: GraphQLID? {
  didSet {
    self.configureView()
  }
}
```

This settable property allows the `MasterViewController` to pass along the identifier for the selected launch. The identifier will be used later to load more details about the launch. 

For now, update the `configureView()` method to use this new property (if it's there) instead of the `detailItem` property you just deleted: 

```swift
func configureView() {
  // Update the user interface for the detail item.
  guard
    let label = self.detailDescriptionLabel,
    let id = self.launchID else {
      return
  }

  label.text = "Launch \(id)"
}
```

> **Note**: You're also unwrapping the `detailDescriptionLabel` because even though it's an Implicitly Unwrapped Optional, it won't be present if `configureView` is called before `viewDidLoad`.

Next, back in `MasterViewController.swift`, update the `prepareForSegue` method to obtain the most recently selected row and pass its corresponding launch details to the detail view controller: 

```swift
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
  guard let selectedIndexPath = self.tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow else {
    // Nothing is selected, nothing to do
    return
  }
    
  guard let listSection = ListSection(rawValue: selectedIndexPath.section) else {
    assertionFailure("Invalid section")
    return
  }
    
  switch listSection {
  case .launches:
    guard
      let destination = segue.destination as? UINavigationController,
      let detail = destination.topViewController as? DetailViewController else {
        assertionFailure("Wrong kind of destination")
        return
    }
    
    let launch = self.launches[selectedIndexPath.row]
    detail.launchID = launch.id
    self.detailViewController = detail
  }
}
```

One slightly unrelated detail: In `SceneDelegate.swift`, one line relies on the `detailItem` property you deleted earlier, which now produces an error. Replace the erroring line with:

```swift
if topAsDetailController.launchID == nil {
```

Build and run, and tap on any of the launches. You'll now see the launch ID for the selected launch when you land on the page:


<img src="images/detail_view_launch_id.png" alt="Empty screen with launch ID" width="300">
</img>

The app is working! However, it doesn't provide much useful information. Let's fix that.

## Add more info to the list view

Let's take advantage of one of the built-in styles for `UITableViewCell` to display more information without having to do much work. Go to `Main.storyboard`, select the **Master Scene** which includes the `TableView` and the default cell. 

Expand the dropdowns in the left sidebar of Interface Builder until you get to **Cell**. Select that element, then go to the **Attributes Inspector** in the right sidebar of Xcode. At the top, there's a drop-down that allows you to select a style for your table view cell. Select **Subtitle**:

![](images/use_subtitle_style.png)

While you're here, this is a good time to give the main `TableView` a name that better reflects what it's actually showing. Select the navigation item and rename it from `Master` to `Launches`:

![](images/rename_master_launches.png)

Go back to `LaunchList.graphql`. Your query is already fetching most of the information you want to display, but it would be nice to display both the name of the mission and an image of the patch. 

Looking at the schema in GraphiQL, you can see that `Launch` has a property of `mission`, which allows you to get details of the mission. A mission has both a name and a `missionPatch` property, and the `missionPatch` can optionally take a parameter about what size something needs to be.

Since loading a table view with large images can be a real performance hog, ask for the name and a small mission patch. Update your query to look like the following:

```graphql
query LaunchList {
  launches {
    hasMore
    cursor
    launches {
      id
      site
      mission {
        name
        missionPatch(size: SMALL)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When you recompile, if you look in `API.swift`, you'll see a new nested type, `Mission`, with the two properties you requested.

Since `missionPatch` returns a URL string to an image that can be displayed, you'll want to have a fairly easy setup to display images based on URLs. 

To save time, go to **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...** and add a depenency on [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage). Paste in the URL to its git repo, `https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage.git`, and then select the main `SDWebImage` from the list of package products Xcode offers you once it resolves the repo. 

Once SDWebImage has finished installing, go back to `MasterViewController.swift` and add the following import to the top of the file:

```swift
import SDWebImage
```

You'll use this shortly to load an image based on a URL.

Next, download this image:

![apollo logo](images/placeholder_logo.png)

Drag it into your Asset Catalog, `Assets.xcassets`. Name it `placeholder`:

![image in asset catalog](images/placeholder_in_asset_catalog.png)

You'll use this image as a placeholder to show while the mission patch images are loading. 

Now go back to `MasterViewControl.swift`. In `tableView(cellForRowAt:)`, once the cell is loaded, add the following code to help make sure that before the cell is configured, it clears out any stale data:

```swift
cell.imageView?.image = nil
cell.textLabel?.text = nil
cell.detailTextLabel?.text = nil
```

> **Note**: In a custom `UITableViewCell`, you'd do this by overriding `prepareForReuse` rather than resetting directly in the data source. However, since you're using a stock cell, you have to do it here. 

Next, in the same method, go down to where you're setting up the cell based on the section. Update the code to use the launch mission name as the primary text label, the launch site as the detail text label, and to load the mission patch if it exists:
    
```swift 
switch listSection {
case .launches:
  let launch = self.launches[indexPath.row]
  cell.textLabel?.text = launch.mission?.name
  cell.detailTextLabel?.text = launch.site
    
  let placeholder = UIImage(named: "placeholder")!
    
  if let missionPatch = launch.mission?.missionPatch {
    cell.imageView?.sd_setImage(with: URL(string: missionPatch)!, placeholderImage: placeholder)
  } else {
    cell.imageView?.image = placeholder
  }
}
```

Build and run the application, and you will see all the information for current launches populate: 


<img src="images/launch_list_final.png" alt="Final launch list" width="300">
</img>


If you scroll down, you'll see the list includes only about 20 launches. This is because the list of launches is **paginated**, and you've only fetched the first page. 

Now it's time to learn how to use a cursor-based loading system to load the entire list of launches.

## Use pagination to load additional launches

As you might have noticed, the object returned from the `LaunchListQuery` is a `LaunchConnection`. This object has a list of launches, a pagination cursor, and a boolean to indicate whether more launches exist. 

When using a cursor-based pagination system, it's important to remember that the cursor gives you a place where you can get all results after a certain spot, regardless of whether more items have been added in the interim. 

You're going to use a second section in the TableView to allow your user to load more launches as long as they exist. But how will you know if they exist? First, you need to hang on to the most recently received `LaunchConnection` object.

Add a variable to hold on to this object at the top of the file near your `launches` variable:

```swift
private var lastConnection: LaunchListQuery.Data.Launch?
```

Next, you're going to take advantage of a type from the Apollo library. Add the following to the top of the file:

```swift
import Apollo
```

Then, below `lastConnection`, add a variable to hang on to the most recent request: 

```swift
private var activeRequest: Cancellable?
```

Next, add a second case to your `ListSection` enum:

```swift
enum ListSection: Int, CaseIterable {
  case launches
  case loading
}
```

This allows loading state to be displayed and selected in a separate section, keeping your `launches` section tied to the `launches` variable. 

Next, in `tableView(_:, numberOfRowsInSection:)`, add handling for the `.loading` case, which returns `0` if there are no more launches to load: 

```swift
case .loading:
  if self.lastConnection?.hasMore == false {
    return 0
  } else {
    return 1
  }
```

Remember here that if `lastConnection` is nil, there *are* more launches to load, since we haven't even loaded a first connection. 

Next, add handling for the `.loading` case to `tableView(_, cellForRowAt:)`, showing a different message based on whether there's an active request or not:

```swift
case .loading:
  if self.activeRequest == nil {
    cell.textLabel?.text = "Tap to load more"
  } else {
    cell.textLabel?.text = "Loading..."
  }
```

Next, you'll need to provide the cursor to your `LaunchListQuery`. The good news is that the `launches` API takes an optional `after` parameter, which accepts a cursor. 

To pass a variable into a GraphQL query, you need to use syntax that defines that variable using a `$name` and its type. You can then pass the variable in as a parameter value to an API which takes a parameter.

What does this look like in practice? Go to `LaunchList.graphql` and update just the first two lines to take and use the cursor as a parameter: 

```graphql
query LaunchList($cursor:String) {
  launches(after:$cursor) {
```

Build the application so the code generation picks up on this new parameter. You'll see an error for a non-exhaustive switch, but this is something we'll fix shortly.

Next, go back to `MasterViewController.swift` and update `loadLaunches()` to be `loadMoreLaunches(from cursor: String?)`, hanging on to the active request (and nil'ing it out when it completes), and updating the last received connection: 

```swift
private func loadMoreLaunches(from cursor: String?) {
  self.activeRequest = Network.shared.apollo.fetch(query: LaunchListQuery(cursor: cursor)) { [weak self] result in
    guard let self = self else {
      return
    }
    
    self.activeRequest = nil
    defer {
      self.tableView.reloadData()
    }
    
    switch result {
    case .success(let graphQLResult):
      if let launchConnection = graphQLResult.data?.launches {
        self.lastConnection = launchConnection
        self.launches.append(contentsOf: launchConnection.launches.compactMap { $0 })
      }
    
      if let errors = graphQLResult.errors {
        let message = errors
                        .map { $0.localizedDescription }
                        .joined(separator: "\n")
        self.showErrorAlert(title: "GraphQL Error(s)",
                            message: message)
    }
    case .failure(let error):
      self.showErrorAlert(title: "Network Error",
                          message: error.localizedDescription)
    }
  }
}
```

Then, add a new method to figure out if new launches need to be loaded:

```swift
private func loadMoreLaunchesIfTheyExist() {
  guard let connection = self.lastConnection else {
    // We don't have stored launch details, load from scratch
    self.loadMoreLaunches(from: nil)
    return
  }
    
  guard connection.hasMore else {
    // No more launches to fetch
    return
  }
    
  self.loadMoreLaunches(from: connection.cursor)
}
```

Update `viewDidLoad` to use this new method rather than calling `loadMoreLaunches(from:)` directly:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  self.loadMoreLaunchesIfTheyExist()
}
```

Next, you need to add some handling when the cell is tapped. Normally that's handled by `prepare(for segue:)`, but because you're going to be reloading things in the current view controller, you won't want the segue to perform at all. 

Luckily, you can override the `shouldPerformSegue(withIdentifier:sender:)` method to say, "In this case, don't perform this segue, and take these other actions instead."

Override this method, and add code that performs the segue for anything in the `.launches` section and _doesn't_ perform it (instead loading more launches if needed) for the `.loading` section:


```swift
override func shouldPerformSegue(withIdentifier identifier: String, sender: Any?) -> Bool {
  guard let selectedIndexPath = self.tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow else {
    return false
  }
          
  guard let listSection = ListSection(rawValue: selectedIndexPath.section) else {
    assertionFailure("Invalid section")
    return false
  }
        
switch listSection {
  case .launches:
    return true
  case .loading:
    self.tableView.deselectRow(at: selectedIndexPath, animated: true)

    if self.activeRequest == nil {
      self.loadMoreLaunchesIfTheyExist()
    } // else, let the active request finish loading

    self.tableView.reloadRows(at: [selectedIndexPath], with: .automatic)
    
    // In either case, don't perform the segue
    return false
  }
}
```

Finally, even though you've told the segue system that you don't need to perform the segue for anything in the `.loading` case, the _compiler_ still doesn't know that, and it requires you to handle the `.loading` case in `prepare(for segue:)`. 

However, your code should theoretically never reach this point, so it's a good place to use an `assertionFailure` if you ever hit it during development. This both satisfies the compiler and warns you loudly and quickly if your assumption that something is handled in `shouldPerformSegue` is wrong. 

Add the following to the `switch` statement in `prepare(for segue:)`

```swift
case .loading:
  assertionFailure("Shouldn't have gotten here!")
```

Now, when you build and run and scroll down to the bottom of the list, you'll see a cell you can tap to load more rows: 


<img src="images/tap_to_load_more.png" alt="Screenshot with loading cell" width="300">
</img>


When you tap that cell, the rows will load and then redisplay. If you tap it several times, it reaches a point where the loading cell is no longer displayed, and the last launch was SpaceX's original FalconSat launch from Kwajalien Atoll:


<img src="images/list_all_loaded.png" alt="List with all launches loaded and no loading cell" width="300">
</img>


Congratulations, you've loaded all of the possible launches! But when you tap one, you still get the same boring detail page. 

Next, you'll make the detail page a lot more interesting by taking the ID returned by one query and passing it to another.

## Add more details to the detail view

To get more information to show on the detail page, you have a couple of options: 

- You could request all the details you want to display for every single launch in the `LaunchList` query, and then pass that retrieved object on to the `DetailViewController`. 
- You could provide the identifier of an individual launch to a _different_ query to request all the details you want to display. 

The first option *can* seem easier if there isn't a substantial difference in size between what you're requesting for the list versus the detail page. 

However, remember that one of the advantages of GraphQL is that you can query for _exactly_ the data you need to display on a page. If you're not going to be displaying additional information, you can save bandwidth, execution time, and battery life by not asking for data until you need it.

This is especially true when you have a *much* larger query for your detail view than for your list view. Passing the identifier and then fetching based on that is considered a best practice. Even though the amount of data in this case doesn't differ greatly, you'll build out a query to help fetch details based on the ID so you'll know how to do it in the future. 

Create a new empty file and name it `LaunchDetails.graphql`. In this file, you'll add the details you want to display in the detail view. First, you'll want to go back to GraphiQL and make sure that your query works!

Start by typing in the query name and passing in an ID. Then, try calling the singular `launch` method, which takes the ID as a property, and requesting the `id` back as the query result: 

```graphql
query LaunchDetails($id:ID) {
  launch(id:$id) {
    id  
  }
}
```

You'll see a warning in GraphiQL: 

![variable dollar sign id of type ID was used in position expecting type ID exclamation point](images/graphiql_nullable_conflict.png)

This bit can be confusing for Swift developers, because GraphQL's assumptions about nullability are different from Swift's: 

* In Swift, if you don't annotate a property's type with either a question mark or an exclamation point, that property is non-nullable.

* In GraphQL, if you don't annotate a field's type with an exclamation point, that field is considered *nullable*. This is becasue GraphQL fields are **nullable by default**.

Keep this difference in mind when you switch between editing Swift and GraphQL files.

Now, switch back to GraphiQL. Start by adding the properties you're already requesting in the `LaunchList` query, but use `LARGE` for the mission patch size since the patch will be displayed much larger:


```graphql
query LaunchDetails($id:ID!) {
  launch(id: $id) {
    id
    site
    mission {
      name
      missionPatch(size:LARGE)
    }
  }
}
```

Next, look at the schema to see what other fields are available. For this example, we'll get the available fields on the `Launch`'s `rocket` field, and also whether the launch has been booked or not. Add the following below the closing brace for `mission`: 
 
```graphQL
rocket {
  name
  type
}
isBooked
```

At the bottom of GraphiQL's left panel, you'll see two tabs named "Query Variables" and "HTTP Headers". In "Query Variables", add the following:

```
{ "id": "25" }
```

This tells GraphiQL to fill in the value of the `$id` variable with the value `"25"` when it runs the query. Press the big play button, and you should get some results back for the launch with ID 25: 

![screenshot - detail request returning json](images/graphiql_detail_request.png)

Now that you've confirmed it worked, copy the query and paste it into your `LaunchDetails.graphql` file. Build the application so that codegen picks up this new file and generates a new query type for it. 

Now that you know what you're planning to ask for, it's time to set up the UI for the detail screen. Go to `DetailViewController.swift`. First, add a place to hang on to the result of the query. Add the following property to the top of the class: 

```swift
private var launch: LaunchDetailsQuery.Data.Launch?
```

Next, delete the `self.detailDescriptionLabel` outlet and replace it with the following list of outlets:

```swift
@IBOutlet private var missionPatchImageView: UIImageView!
@IBOutlet private var missionNameLabel: UILabel!
@IBOutlet private var rocketNameLabel: UILabel!
@IBOutlet private var launchSiteLabel: UILabel!
@IBOutlet private var bookCancelButton: UIBarButtonItem!
```

Now in `Main.storyboard`, go to the **Detail Scene**. Delete the existing label. 

This next (collapsed) section covers setting up constraints in detail to match the way things work in the sample application. You're welcome to use the five outlets listed above in an alternate setup if you'd prefer, but screenshots for the remainder of these tutorials are based on this section. 

To follow the precise UI setup instructions, expand this panel:

<DetailUISetupPanel />

In the end, your detail view controller should look like this in the storyboard (or roughly like it in whatever alternate setup you've decided to use): 

![The storyboard's final look](images/storyboard_final.png)

Now it's time to hook everything up! Head back to `DetailViewController.swift` and update the `viewDidLoad` function to clear out anything from the storyboard before attempting to configure the view:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()

  self.missionNameLabel.text = "Loading..."
  self.launchSiteLabel.text = nil
  self.rocketNameLabel.text = nil
  self.configureView()
}
```

Delete the existing contents of `configureView()`. In their place, start by adding a check that we have something to display, and a place to display it:

```swift
guard
  self.missionNameLabel != nil,
  let launch = self.launch else {
    return
}
```   
    
Next, it's time to display all the informaton you've gotten from your GraphQL server. Remember that GraphQL properties are nullable by default, so you'll often need to provide handling for when a given property is `nil`. 

Add the following code below the `guard` statement you just added:
   
```swift 
self.missionNameLabel.text = launch.mission?.name
self.title = launch.mission?.name

let placeholder = UIImage(named: "placeholder")!
    
if let missionPatch = launch.mission?.missionPatch {
  self.missionPatchImageView.sd_setImage(with: URL(string: missionPatch)!, placeholderImage: placeholder)
} else {
  self.missionPatchImageView.image = placeholder
}

if let site = launch.site {
  self.launchSiteLabel.text = "Launching from \(site)"
} else {
  self.launchSiteLabel.text = nil
}
    
if 
  let rocketName = launch.rocket?.name ,
  let rocketType = launch.rocket?.type {
    self.rocketNameLabel.text = "🚀 \(rocketName) (\(rocketType))"
} else {
  self.rocketNameLabel.text = nil
}
    
if launch.isBooked {
  self.bookCancelButton.title = "Cancel trip"
  self.bookCancelButton.tintColor = .red
} else {
  self.bookCancelButton.title = "Book now!"
  self.bookCancelButton.tintColor = self.view.tintColor
}
```

Then, add a method to load the details using the `LaunchDetailsQuery` you created earlier:

```swift
private func loadLaunchDetails() {
  guard
    let launchID = self.launchID,
    launchID != self.launch?.id else {
      // This is the launch we're alrady displaying, or the ID is nil.
      return
  }
    
  Network.shared.apollo.fetch(query: LaunchDetailsQuery(id: launchID)) { [weak self] result in
    guard let self = self else {
      return
    }
    
    switch result {
    case .failure(let error):
      print("NETWORK ERROR: \(error)")
    case .success(let graphQLResult):
      if let launch = graphQLResult.data?.launch {
        self.launch = launch
      }
    
      if let errors = graphQLResult.errors {
        print("GRAPHQL ERRORS: \(errors)")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, update the `didSet` for `launchID` to load the launch details if we don't already have them: 

```swift
var launchID: GraphQLID? {
  didSet {
    self.loadLaunchDetails()
  }
}
```

and add a `didSet` on the `launch` property to load the UI once the launch is actually loaded. 

```swift
private var launch: LaunchDetailsQuery.Data.Launch? {
  didSet {
    self.configureView()
  }
}
```

Build and run the application. When you tap into the detail screen, you should now see the full details:

You'll notice that many of the more recent launches have a rocket type of `FT`. If you load more launches a couple times, you'll get to some rockets that have different rocket types:

## Recap

In this part of the tutorial, you have: 

- Updated your query to get more information
- Updated your app to pass information between screens
- Created a second query to get more information than was necessary for the first query
- Used all the data you've received from your queries to populate your user interface. 

You may have noticed that every single launch you drill into has the `Book Now!` button - nothing is booked yet, because you haven't had a way to make changes or even to identify yourself.
